#Code your detention class here. Your class should:
#1. Initialize with three attributes: location (i.e. "Rm 366"), time (i.e. "12:45 pm"), and an array of students (i.e. @students=[])
#2. Be able to pass in the location and time as arguments upon initialization
#3. Have a method called "add students" that takes a student name as an argument and adds it to the students list.
#4. Have an attribute accessor for all three attributes
#5. Bonus: Have additional methods or attributes of your choosing that help to better define detention.
