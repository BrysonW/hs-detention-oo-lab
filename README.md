Detention is the WORST. We've all been there at one point or another. And funny enough, experiences of detention are generally pretty similar regardless of where you come from and what kind of school you go to: sit in a classroom and mope, with a grumpy teacher staying after school to punish you.

Use the rspec tests to guide you in building a `Detention` class.
